# The 2026 Optimism Calendar â€” Public Good

This repository hosts The 2026 Optimism Calendar ðŸ“…  
A free public good created in the Optimism style, designed to inspire, motivate, and remind us that every month is a chance to Build For Good.  

The calendar is part of my broader RetroPGF contribution â€” alongside books, NFTs, comics, DAO, the OP Hymn & bot, and more.
